### Which JOIN is Faster in SQL and Why?
- ‚û°Ô∏è `INNER JOIN` is usually the fastest because it only returns matching rows, reducing the result set and memory use.
- ‚û°Ô∏è `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` are slower because they return unmatched rows.
- ‚û°Ô∏è `FULL OUTER` JOIN is the slowest because it processes the largest possible dataset.

- `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` have the same performance if the execution plan and indexes are identical.
- ‚úÖ `LEFT JOIN` is better for code readability and consistency.
- ‚úÖ Most SQL optimizers convert `RIGHT JOIN` into `LEFT JOIN` internally anyway.
- ‚û°Ô∏è Stick to `LEFT JOIN` unless there's a very specific reason to use `RIGHT JOIN`. 

**üëâ Best Practices for Fast JOINs**
- ‚úÖ Create indexes on join columns.
- ‚úÖ Avoid `SELECT *`; only select needed columns.
- ‚úÖ Prefer `INNER JOIN` if possible ‚Äî it‚Äôs usually faster.
- ‚úÖ Minimize data size using `WHERE` clauses.
- ‚úÖ Ensure tables are properly normalized.
