- The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.
- Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved
- Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling
- Improved risk management and cost estimation
- Systematic software delivery and better customer satisfaction
